# Browser Extensions

[![Check Links](https://github.com/Technetium1/BrowserExtensions/actions/workflows/links.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Technetium1/BrowserExtensions/actions)

## What is this?

I use a lot of extensions to make my browsing experience more enjoyable. This is a list of everything I use (or at least have installed), a brief description of what they do, and a link to the extension's store pages, and the homepage / source code.

## Why?

Manifest v3 is here, and it has already resulted in the death of many older extensions. Some have already been removed by the author because they don't want to (or cannot) do a rewrite, while others were forcefully removed. Of utmost importance is the future of blocking trackers and advertisements, which Google wishes to neutralize. I'm moving to Firefox-based browsers as a result of their choices, and this requires sorting through these many addons. May as well make a useful list that everyone can use.

### Watch on Odysee

Automatically redirect YouTube links to Odysee when a video is also available there. This was removed from the Chrome Web Store due to Google's policies against YouTube redirectors. It can be sideloaded into Chrome, but is not recommended.
