# Browser Extensions

[![Check Links](https://github.com/Technetium1/BrowserExtensions/actions/workflows/links.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Technetium1/BrowserExtensions/actions)

## What is this?

I use a lot of extensions to make my browsing experience more enjoyable. This is a list of everything I use (or at least have installed), a brief description of what they do, and a link to the extension's store pages, and the homepage / source code.

## Why?

Manifest v3 is here, and it has already resulted in the death of many older extensions. Some have already been removed by the author because they don't want to (or cannot) do a rewrite, while others were forcefully removed. Of utmost importance is the future of blocking trackers and advertisements, which Google wishes to neutralize. I'm moving to Firefox-based browsers as a result of their choices, and this requires sorting through these many addons. May as well make a useful list that everyone can use.

### Auto Tab Discard

Automatically discard inactive tabs after a specified amount of time to reduce memory usage and prevent background scripts from consuming computational resources when it is not in use. This extension uses the native method for tab discarding, which means it does not suffer from the same issues as other extensions that use custom methods. When a tab is discarded by the native method, it is completely removed from memory and does not use any resources, but it can be restored to its previous state, including preserving page state such as scroll position. The extension also allows you to configure an exception list and specify types of tabs that should not be discarded, such as pinned tabs or tabs that are playing media. This is a direct replacement/upgrade from [`The Marvellous Suspender`](#the-marvellous-suspender).

### Watch on Odysee

Automatically redirect YouTube links to Odysee when a video is also available there. This was removed from the Chrome Web Store due to Google's policies against YouTube redirectors. It can be sideloaded into Chrome, but is not recommended.

**NOTICE:** Requires a popup exception for `youtube.com` to function properly!
